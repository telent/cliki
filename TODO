See http://ww.telent.net/cliki/TODO%20List for features

Look at the source for XXX ("fix me eventually") and TODO ("fix me soon")
comments for things to do in support of those features.  You can use
the supplied Perl script to do this for you: "perl make-TODO.pl *.lisp"

view-recent-changes has calls to cliki:dayname that prolly ought to
use net.telent.date

We need to be able to edit a page's aliases, which involves UI design
of some kind.  Another box on the edit page?
