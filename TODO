See http://ww.telent.net/cliki/TODO%20List for features

Look at the source for XXX ("fix me eventually") and TODO ("fix me soon")
comments for things to do in support of those features.  You can use
the supplied Perl script to do this for you: "perl TODO.pl *.lisp"

view-recent-changes has calls to cliki:dayname that prolly ought to
use net.telent.date

Let's punt on aliases for the moment.  eventually we need to be able
to edit a page's aliases: another box on the edit page?

Searches (/ syntax) are borken

Test asd dependcencies
