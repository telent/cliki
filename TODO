This is a project plan

(1) create PAGE-OBJECT and TEXT-PAGE-OBJECT

(2) Some way to instantiate an object would be nice.  I say we read it
from the filesystem and guess the object type from filename extension.
Butcher the edit handler to do this, also parsing the categories and
suchlike.

(3) Write methods on TEXT-PAGE-OBJECT to do view and view-for-edit
(from ram) and save (to disk)

(4) Add methods to

- rename an object
- delete an object
- search against criteria

(5) write the search code

(n) finish porting araneida to :sockets
