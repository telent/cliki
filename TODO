See http://ww.telent.net/cliki/TODO%20List for features

Look at the source for XXX ("fix me eventually") and TODO ("fix me soon")
comments for things to do in support of those features.  You can use
the supplied Perl script to do this for you: "perl make-TODO.pl *.lisp"

view-recent-changes has calls to cliki:dayname that prolly ought to
use net.telent.date

We need to be able to edit a page's aliases, which involves UI design
of some kind.  Another box on the edit page?

access control


* CLiki
** funny chars in page names 
** topic synonyms, UI for
** read-only/authenticated version
  - produce cookie based on username and some kind of secret

  need to continue to support the crrent workflow too, btw

  - check cookie in authentication handler
  - add some kind of acl to each page, inheriting sensibly from, um,
     some other page (what other page?)
  - access rights are :view, :edit, :comment  (append-only)

for non-trivial authiz handlers we need UI changes to get the details
when an unauthenticated request comes in: don't want to let people do
their edits _before_ telling them they don't have the rights to save.

so, authentication and authorization handlers on the edit-handler.
But we don't bother authenticating if the page access perms say that 
anybody may edit

groups:
- anonymous user
- any named user
- a user
- recursively, a list of groups

somewhere we need to store the edit permissions per-page.
persistently, yes.  I guess we could put them in the .titles files.
we also need to store the user group data 

somehow we need a policy for edit perms on new pages

ideally also we need a UI for changing it.  and titles.  



** Can we use cliki as a photo manager?

- "photo" pages: one picture and some text
- "collection" pages: text and many half-sized photos being links to 
  the relevant photo pages
- some convenience for page naming when uploading a whole collection
- convenient internal anchor syntax for collection pages (then it
  could be used as a diary): should also accept a human-readable title
  so that collections can have associated rdf files
