* Building it

You need 

 - Araneida (http://araneida.telent.net/) and all that that implies.

 - ASDF (http://ww.telent.net/cliki/asdf)

Use asdf with the system definition 

* Using it

You need to create a cliki-instance object and install cliki-handler
somewhere in your URL hierarchy.  For example

(defvar *cliki-instance* nil)
(setf *cliki-instance*
      (make-instance 'cliki::cliki-instance
                     :data-directory "/var/www/cliki/"
                     :url-root (merge-url ww-url "/cliki/")))
(install-handler *root-handler* *cliki-instance* 
		 (merge-url ww-url "/cliki/") nil)

data-directory is where the data files will be created, so must be
writable by the user who is running the CL instance.  It must contain
the file admin/recent-changes.dat, which can initially be empty 

If you would like to run multiple CLikis on the same server, you can
do that with multiple cliki-instances.  If you want them to have
different look and feel, you can create a subclass of cliki-instance
and specialize 

(defmethod cliki:cliki-css-text ((cliki your-cliki-instance) stream)
 ...)

and 

(defmethod cliki:cliki-page-header
    ((cliki your-cliki-instance) request title &optional head)
 ...)


The customizability was added in the space of about two hours on one
Sunday evening, and designed on the premise that it served my
immediate need.  If it doesn't serve yours, I'm open to patches.
