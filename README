* Building it

You need 

 - Araneida (http://araneida.telent.net/) and all that that implies.

 - ASDF (http://ww.telent.net/cliki/asdf)

Use asdf with the system definition 

* Using it

You need to create a cliki-instance object and install cliki-handler
somewhere in your URL hierarchy.  See example.lisp for, as the name
suggests, an example.

data-directory is where the data files will be created, so must be
writable by the user who is running the CL instance.

If you would like to run multiple CLikis on the same listener, you can
do that with multiple cliki-instances.  If you want them to have
different look and feel, you can create a subclass of cliki-instance
and specialize various methods.
