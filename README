See the live CLiki at http://ww.telent.net/cliki/

Prerequsite: araneida (http://araneida.telent.net/) and all that that
implies.

To make it work, 

1) build it using the system definition (or the Makefile, which calls
 it)
2) get an araneida instance going
3) evaluate something like

  (cliki::export-handlers (merge-url araneida-examples::*static-url* "/cliki/")
                          *cliki-source-pathname*))

where *cliki-source-pathname* is the writable directory where you want
the data stored

4) there you go.  Enjoy.  Post a note on http://ww.telent.net/cliki/CLiki
to let people know how you got on
