New in CLiki 0.4.0

* Visual makeover.  Thanks to Miles Egan for doing the hard work, and
  apologies to him for my subsequent attempts to wreck it again.

* ?download request redirects now merge against cclan

* Very slight documentation update

* New :package tag is actually pretty similar to :download but explicitly
  for ASDF systems

* Some bug fixes: 
  - pages no longer show themselves in 'related pages' lists
  - RDF file has working link for Recent Changes page
  - empty pages can be edited again

New in CLiki 0.3.9

* Wholesale changes to take advantage of the new handler model in
  Araneida 0.69+ (i.e. you need that too)

* Potentially backward-incompatible change: now redirects requests
  for the foo.html url to the foo page.  This has been threatened 
  for years

* Default search result page gets a summary of matched text for each
  matching document

* CLIKI-DEFAULT-PAGE-NAME method lets you have a start page called something
  other than `index'

* ADD-TO-INDEX-FOR-PAGE methods can now also add their arguments to the 
  TF index, so that text in :(foo ...) constructs can be picked up in
  full-text searching 

* recent changes is now always displayed in GMT

* Javascript link in default page header method to create new page

* Removed (in hindsight, silly) >(foo) download syntax

* Targets for 0.4: perhaps some documentation.  Lift the user auth from 
  Entomotomy and include it here.  Bug fixes (please report bugs)


New in CLiki 0.3.3

* RDF RSS (0.92, insofar as it exists) export for Recent Changes

* Major changes to internal workings of search and indexes such that the
  index collection is now extensible: index.lisp should be reasonably clear.
  CLiki 0.4 will happen when some work has been done on the search side of it
  and some documentation written

* CLiki syntax (_(foo), *(bar) etc) parsing radically changed to help with
  index chages as above.  

* The latter two should have produced little or no user-visible changes to
  existing cliki pages

New in CLiki 0.3.2

* New syntax for marking the >(download) URL of a package

* Uses new Araneida cookie accessors (so yes, you need a new Araneida as well)

* Default CLHS URL changed to lisp.org, as they still have the old Hyperspec
  page names.  This is a stopgap measure, really

New in CLiki 0.3.1

* Nothing much.  Now builds using asdf

New in CLiki 0.3

* Hyperspec lookups (thanks to Eric Marsden for the code)

* A full-text search engine (thanks to Neil W. Van Dyke for
  introducing me to tfidf and pointing me at articles)

* Multiple CLiki instances can co-exist in the same Lisp instance

* Recent Changes view is now paged for speed of downloading

* Can optionally use a cookie to remember the editors' names
