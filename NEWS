New in CLiki 0.3.2

* New syntax for marking the >(download) URL of a package

* Uses new Araneida cookie accessors (so yes, you need a new Araneida as well)

* Default CLHS URL changed to lisp.org, as they still have the old Hyperspec
  page names.  This is a stopgap measure, really

New in CLiki 0.3.1

* Nothing much.  Now builds using asdf

New in CLiki 0.3

* Hyperspec lookups (thanks to Eric Marsden for the code)

* A full-text search engine (thanks to Neil W. Van Dyke for
  introducing me to tfidf and pointing me at articles)

* Multiple CLiki instances can co-exist in the same Lisp instance

* Recent Changes view is now paged for speed of downloading

* Can optionally use a cookie to remember the editors' names
